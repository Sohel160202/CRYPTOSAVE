# CRYPTOSAVE: A Dynamic Multi-Slice Encryption Architecture for Tamper-Resistant Game Save Systems

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Overview

**CRYPTOSAVE** is a theoretical framework that proposes a novel approach to protect single-player game save files from tampering, manipulation, and reverse engineering. By leveraging dynamic session-based encryption and multi-slice save segmentation, this system seeks to introduce a lightweight yet robust anti-cheat architecture for indie and commercial developers alike.

This repository hosts the accompanying paper and metadata for submission to the **Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)**.

## Features

- üîê Session-specific encryption keys for each save event
- üß© Multi-slice fragmentation of save data to prevent brute-force tampering
- üîÅ Rotating checksum and integrity validation layers
- üõ°Ô∏è Runtime-agnostic: compatible with any engine or platform that supports basic I/O
- üìÑ Full theoretical security analysis and reference-based threat mapping

## Statement of Purpose

Tampering with game save files undermines fairness and player experience, especially in progression-heavy or achievement-based titles. Existing anti-cheat tools largely focus on multiplayer exploits and are often too heavy-handed or inaccessible for indie developers. CRYPTOSAVE addresses this gap by offering a flexible, theoretical blueprint for client-side save protection.

## Acknowledgments

This framework was inspired by real-world case studies of reverse engineering, tampering attempts, and the limitations of static encryption in game security systems.
