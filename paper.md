# Summary

CRYPTOSAVE is a theoretical framework designed to secure single-player game save files against tampering and manipulation. With an architecture based on dynamic encryption layers and multi-slice file segmentation, the system proposes a model to enhance game integrity without requiring constant server-side verification. The design counters memory editor manipulation, offline cheat injection, and rollback hacks, offering a practical anti-tamper mechanism for developers with limited server infrastructure.

# Statement of need

In an era where in-game progress and unlockables influence player retention and monetization, the manipulation of save files presents a significant threat to the integrity of single-player games. Existing solutions either rely heavily on obfuscation or require persistent online validation, which is not always feasible for indie or offline-first games. CRYPTOSAVE fills this gap by offering a client-side focused, multi-layer encryption strategy that is dynamic, tamper-aware, and modular enough to be adapted across game engines. This work aims to inspire future implementations and spark innovation in protecting player data without intrusive DRM or constant online checks.
